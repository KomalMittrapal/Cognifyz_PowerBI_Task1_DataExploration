# 📊 Cognifyz Internship – Task 1: Data Exploration & Summary (Power BI)

This repository contains my submission for **Task 1** of the **Power BI Internship** offered by **Cognifyz Technologies**.


## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal of this task is to **understand and summarize key statistics** from the dataset using **Power BI**, without writing any DAX formulas — focusing only on built-in Power BI tools and visuals.


## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset (`Data_set_2.csv`) contains information about respondents’:
- Gender and Age  
- Investment avenues (Mutual Funds, Equity Market, Bonds, Fixed Deposits, etc.)  
- Savings objectives and investment purposes  
- Duration and frequency of investments  
- Sources of financial information  


## 🛠️ Steps Performed

### 1. Data Import & Cleaning
- Imported the dataset using **Get Data → CSV** in Power BI.  
- Checked data types and removed duplicates/blanks.  
- Renamed columns where necessary for clarity.  

### 2. Data Exploration
Used **Power BI’s drag-and-drop visual tools** to perform analysis:
- Calculated **Average Age** using default aggregation.  
- Counted total respondents automatically using card visuals.  
- Used **bar and pie charts** to visualize investment preferences and objectives.

### 3. Visuals Created
| Visual | Purpose | Title Used |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Card Visuals | Show KPIs | Average Age, Investors by Type, Total Gender, Total Mutual Funds, Total Equity Market |
| Bar Chart | Compare investment preferences | Preferred Investment Avenues |
| Column Chart | Show savings objectives | Most Common Savings Objectives |
| Bar Chart | Show reasons for investing | Reasons Behind Investment Decisions |
| Donut Chart | Display info sources | Where Do People Get Investment Information? |
| Funnel Chart | Display Total by Gender | Total number of gender involved |
| Table | Display sample respondent data | Sample Respondent Details |
| Text Box | Key Insights Summary | Key Insights & Observations |

### 4. Filters / Slicers
- Added **Gender** and **Source** slicers for interactivity.  
- Linked slicers to all visuals for dynamic filtering.

### 5. Formatting & Design
- Used the **(Red + Yellow)** color palette.  
- Added clear titles, data labels, and alternate row colors in tables.  
- Placed visuals in a **3×3 grid layout** for professional alignment.

## 📊 Insights Summary

1. **Average Age** of respondents ≈ *28 years*.  
2. **Debentures** and **Gold** are the most common investment choices.  
3. The top **savings objective** is *Retirement Plan*.
